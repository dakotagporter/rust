/////// Slices
// Similar to slices in Python, slices in Rust do NOT have ownership.
// String literals:
let s = "Hello, world!"
//  - Here, s is an immutable because it's type is &str (a pointer to a specific location in binary)
//  - You can take slices of both literals and String types.
//  - Using rewrite_first_word function above is the most generalized we can make it. It will take
//    both String and &str types.
//  - Can also slice arrays.

////// All the process ensure memory safety at compile time.
// The Rust language gives you control over your memory usage in the same way as other systems programming languages, but having the owner of data automatically
// clean up that data when the owner goes out of scope means you donâ€™t have to write and debug extra code to get this control.
